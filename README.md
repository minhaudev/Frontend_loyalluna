# Next.js Project

This is a graduation thesis project focused on healthcare project management, similar to Sapo. It utilizes Next.js 14 (app directory) to create a modern web application.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started): A React framework for building server-rendered applications and static websites.
- [NextUI v2](https://nextui.org/): A modern React UI library that provides a set of beautiful, customizable components.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without leaving your HTML.
- [Tailwind Variants](https://tailwind-variants.org): A utility for handling variants in Tailwind CSS.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): A powerful library for creating animations and transitions in React applications.
- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes): A library for managing themes in Next.js applications, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Provides fast page loads and improves SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generates static pages at build time for better performance.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI using Tailwind CSS and NextUI.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth transitions and animations using Framer Motion.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Easy toggling between light and dark themes with `next-themes`.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of a modern web application using Next.js and its ecosystem. It incorporates Tailwind CSS for styling, NextUI for components, and TypeScript for type safety. Animations are handled with Framer Motion, and theme management is done using `next-themes`.

We hope this project serves as a template or inspiration for others working with these technologies.
